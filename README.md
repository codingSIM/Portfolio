# Portfolio
Repository documenting the history of my portfolio website versions.
All releases have tried to add something on top of previous versions in order to showcase improvement and growth.

## Current (Release 6)
My current developer portfolio makes more use of css variables compared to other releases. It is also one of the most responsive websites I have created.
There are still a lot of things to learn which is why I've documented some next steps in this repository.

Features:
* Responsive website, single-page (About, Education, Projects, Contact), dark-theme
* CSS variables 
* Collapsibles and lists
* anchor-list menu
* flexbox

# Next plans
---
* Utility classes (text-center, colours... etc)
* Addition with media queries rather than simplification, min-width @media queries

* Look into using more advanced selectors and variables within css
* Learn more about animations
* Learn more about combining images with text
* Attempt having more than 1 accent colour? (Green/Orange?)
* Website preview / logo?
* Change look of projects section maybe?
* Slide section for contact?
* Add bg image?

* Consider re-adding pop-ups? Or making a gallery section / add images for projects?
